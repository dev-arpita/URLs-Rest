8. Try to think of a time you used each of the four main methods
   (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in the real world as you went about
   your regular usage of the internet. E.g. today, I checked the
   weather on my phone which probably sent a GET request to retrieve
   weather information.

GET: I open Scrimba.com URL to open Scrimba my current course page,
it's a GET Request to retrive the course information.

POST: When I save my notes in each videos that I POST Request my notes to server.

PUT: When I edit some code in my existing notes that is the PUT Request.

DELETE: When I delete my notes that is the DELETE Request send to server to delete the notes.
